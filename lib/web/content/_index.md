## About

The Osiris Project provides
[documentation](@/w/learn.md),
[infrastructure](@/w/community.md),
[tooling](@/w/learn.md),
and
[support-crates](https://github.com/osiris-apis/osi)
for application development in Rust.

It is a collective effort
to document how Rust can empower developers to write efficient applications for
a wide range of target platforms, including desktop and mobile, and to
further the Rust language to better align with the requirements of application
developers.
